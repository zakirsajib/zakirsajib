### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Zakir Sajib.
I'm a full-stack Web Developer (Yes both front and backend) with React, Gatsby, WordPress and Node experience.

## Static site with Gatsby - Set up WordPress as a headless CMS to build content, then render the content ( including posts, pages, menus, media, advanced custom fields ) with GraphQL. Code repository is usually either GitHub or GitLab and can be hosted on Netlify.

Single Page Application (SPA) in React with Firebase.

E-commerce site development with WooCommerce. Features include: Bookings/Subscriptions/Memberships/Drop-shipping/Affiliate Store/Paid Job Listings/Marketplace.

WordPress/WooCommerce plugin development - Bring your plugin idea and I will implement it for you.
