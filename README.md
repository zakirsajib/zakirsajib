### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Zakir Sajib.
I'm a full-stack Web Developer (Yes both front and backend) with React, Gatsby, WordPress and Node experience.

## Core services

### Single Page Application (SPA) in React or Headless CMS with Gatsby, Frontity
Set up WordPress as a headless CMS to build content, then render the content ( including posts, pages, menus, media, advanced custom fields ) with GraphQL. Code repository is usually either GitHub or GitLab and can be hosted on Netlify or Vercel.

Usually, the client sends me PSD/Sketch/Zeplin/XD and I develop a complete WordPress theme from scratch.

### E-commerce site development with WooCommerce. 
Features include: Bookings/Subscriptions/Memberships/Drop-shipping/Affiliate Store/Paid Job Listings/Marketplace.

### WordPress/WooCommerce plugin development
Bring your plugin idea and I will implement it for you.
